# Andy Mahndy's Handy Dandy Nonograms

### What is a nonogram?
A nonogram is a logic puzzle in which the player is tasked with shading tiles on a grid based on given clues in order to reveal a hidden picture. Clues are written in the form of one or a few numbers in sequence, denoting how many tiles in their designated row/column are shaded in a row. There must be at least one unshaded tile in between each sequence of shaded tiles. You can read more about Nonograms [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram).

### What does this program do?
This program contians 5 pre-made nonogram puzzles. You may navigate freely between each puzzle using the arrow buttons, or choose a random puzzle using the "Random Puzzle" button. Left click a square to shade it; right click to indicate that it cannot be shaded with an "X". Left or right click on a square that is already shaded or crossed out to return it to normal. You may clear the entire board using the "Clear" button. If you solve the puzzle, you will be greeted with a victory screen. Have fun!
